Here's a high-level breakdown of what you need to do to complete your Storage Application project in TypeScript with MongoDB and Mongoose:

1. Setup Your Development Environment:
Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
Install TypeScript: If you haven't installed it yet, use npm install -g typescript.
Create a project directory: Create your working directory and initialize it with npm init.
Install Mongoose: Run npm install mongoose.
Create a .env file: Add your MongoDB credentials and URL to connect to the database.
Install dotenv: Run npm install dotenv to manage your environment variables.
2. Setup TypeScript:
Create a tsconfig.json file to configure TypeScript. Include settings for strict, esModuleInterop, and others as needed.
Run npx tsc --init to initialize the TypeScript config.
3. Project Structure:
Models: Create a folder for your Mongoose models (e.g., models/).
Controllers: Create a folder for your CRUD operations and other business logic (e.g., controllers/).
Utilities: Add any helper functions, such as database connection logic, into a utils/ folder.
Error Handling: Have a dedicated error handling module (e.g., errorHandlers/).
4. Create Mongoose Schemas:
Item Schema: Create a base Item schema and extend it for Tool and Material.
Use Mongoose inheritance by creating a base Item schema and discriminator for the child classes.
User Schema: Create a schema for User that includes fields for name, age, and methods to use tools and materials.
5. CRUD Operations:
Create: Implement create operations for adding new tools, materials, and users.
Read: Implement read operations to retrieve all items, specific items, or users.
Update: Add methods to update item details, such as changing the condition of a tool or updating material stock.
Delete: Implement deletion logic to remove items or users from the database.
6. Error Handling:
Use try-catch blocks for your CRUD operations.
Add validation to Mongoose schemas to prevent invalid data from being saved.
Handle cases such as:
Trying to use a tool in poor condition.
Deleting non-existent items.
Adding tools or materials with missing required fields.
7. MongoDB Connection:
In the db.ts file, use Mongoose to connect to your MongoDB database. Include login credentials from the .env file for security.
8. Implement populate functionality:
In the User schema, implement methods that allow you to:
useItem: When a user uses an item, it should be added to the list of borrowed tools.
usedItems: Populate and return the list of tools used by a specific user.
buildSomething: Simulate a user building something with materials and tools, and update the quantities accordingly.
9. Write Unit Tests (Optional but Recommended):
Test your CRUD operations, including edge cases (e.g., using a broken tool, trying to delete an item that doesnâ€™t exist).
10. Run and Verify:
Once your code is complete, start your application using ts-node or compile TypeScript and run with Node.js.
Use Postman or similar tools to test your CRUD endpoints (if you build an API), or directly interact with your MongoDB database to verify that all functionality works.
